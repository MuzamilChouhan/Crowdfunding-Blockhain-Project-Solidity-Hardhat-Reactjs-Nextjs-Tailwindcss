Getting Started

Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

Node.js (v16 or later)

npm (v8 or later)

Hardhat (for Ethereum development)

Installation

Build crowdfunding-project from the source and install dependencies:

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/MuzamilChouhan/crowdfunding-project

Navigate to the project directory

cd crowdfunding-project

Install the dependencies

npm install

Install Hardhat globally (if not installed)

npm run dev

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

Running a Local Blockchain

To simulate a blockchain environment locally, start a local Ethereum node with Hardhat:

npx hardhat node

This will start a local Ethereum network and provide you with test accounts and a local RPC URL (http://127.0.0.1:8545).

Compiling and Deploying Contracts

Compile your smart contracts:

npx hardhat compile

Deploy contracts to the local network:
Create a script in the scripts/ folder, for example deploy.js, and run:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

Make sure the Hardhat node is running before deploying.

Testing

To test the smart contracts:

npx hardhat test
