## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires the following dependencies:

* **Node.js** (v16 or later)
* **npm** (v8 or later)
* **Hardhat** (for Ethereum development)

### Installation

Build crowdfunding-project from the source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuzamilChouhan/crowdfunding-project
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd crowdfunding-project
```

3. **Install the dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

4. **Install Hardhat locally (if not installed)**

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

5. **Initialize Hardhat project (if needed)**

```bash
npx hardhat
```

Choose "Create a basic sample project" and follow the prompts.

---

## Usage

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

---

## Running a Local Blockchain

To simulate a blockchain environment locally, start a local Ethereum node with Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This will start a local Ethereum network and provide you with test accounts and a local RPC URL ([http://127.0.0.1:8545](http://127.0.0.1:8545)).

---

## Compiling and Deploying Contracts

1. **Compile your smart contracts**:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. **Deploy contracts to the local network**:

Create a deployment script inside the `scripts/` folder (e.g., `deploy.js`) and include your deployment logic.

Then run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Make sure the Hardhat node is running before deploying.

---

## Testing

To test the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
